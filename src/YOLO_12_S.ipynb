A precisão para drones se mantém consistentemente alta. A detecção de tratores exibe maior variabilidade entre as épocas. Ao considerar a métrica mais rigorosa (mAP50-95), observa-se que a época 90 frequentemente apresenta os melhores resultados, especialmente para a detecção geral e de tratores.\n","\n","Portanto, o sistema mostra potencial na detecção de tratores e drones, com alta precisão, mas o dataset pequeno causa variabilidade (principalmente em tratores) e possível overfitting (queda no mAP50-95 na validação). Drones são detectados com mais facilidade. Sendo assim,  o modelo que apresentou melhor resultado de forma geral foi o de 90 épocas por equilibrar precisão geral e localização (melhor mAP50-95 para tratores), minimizando o overfitting. A expansão do dataset é crucial para o desempenho futuro."],"metadata":{"id":"C68yOsdZ9ukb"}}]}
